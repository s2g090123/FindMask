Note: This app is no longer updated after 2020 and some functions may not be executable.

## About
Find Mask helps users find nearby mask distribution points and view their detailed information and the number of available masks. This app uses Play Services - Location to obtain the device's current location, searches for detailed information about locations the Places API, and uses Retrofit to make API calls to obtain the number of available masks and display them on the map.

## Technology
Use the MVVM architectural pattern.

Here are the key technologies I've used to create this app:
- Coroutine
- Retrofit
- Play Services Location
- Places
